# Damn Anagrams

## Introduction

The aim of this project was to create a web based Anagram solver. We needed it to solve three letter anagrams, but if possible more.

### High level functional specifications
- Accepts users input.

- Compares the letters and length of the word with the library.

- Solves Anagrams.
- Has built in library.

### High level non-functional specifications

- The ability to solve longer anagrams.
- Possible link to definition of found word.

### Application requirements
### Mock-ups
### Storyboards
### Flowcharts components
### High-level user stories
### Research
### Teamwork



## Troubleshooting

- An issue i had, was that my program was displaying every word in my ![](https://i.imgur.com/SrcldYe.png) file. So that i could test my code without fear of it crashing. I created a smaller file named ![](https://i.imgur.com/7AGFixB.png) this file contained several words, making it much less intensive.
- It was a learning curve linking my library to my code. I asked my classmate if he could help me, and he showed me a way. I needed to add the ![](https://i.imgur.com/SrcldYe.png) file (Library of words) to repl.it. After doing this, i needed to link the file to my main code. I linked the two using ![](https://i.imgur.com/sUaok2C.png) . This allowed my program to access the file.

Below is a screenshot showing the problem i encountered. The program is sorting through every word in the "words.csv" file. This was causing lag due to the massive amount of information being processed.

I then made a new file named ![](https://i.imgur.com/7AGFixB.png). This file contained several words, far less than the thousands in ![](https://i.imgur.com/SrcldYe.png). Switching these round made the code far less intensive.

## Repl.it
- This IDE made it very easy to upload external files. Incorporating the external file containing the library was integral to the project. 
- When making a mistake, for example leaving out a "{", or mispelling. Repl.it would alert me to it, and then show me the character(s) that needed reviewal. This was extremely helpful as it saves time.

- Another benefit of repl.it is their websites UI. The code on the left side, and the console on the right. This makes testing my code easy, which is a benefit to me because learning.

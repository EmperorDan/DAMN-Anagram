# Damn Anagrams

## Introduction
The aim of this project was to create a web based Anagram solver. We needed it to solve three letter anagrams, but if possible more.

## Mechanics
- Solves Anagrams.
- Has built in library.

## Troubleshooting
- An issue i had, was that my program was displaying every word in my "words.csv" file. So that i could test my code without fear of it crashing. I created a smaller file named "wordy" this file contained several words, making it much less intensive.
- It was a learning curve linking my library to my code. I asked my classmate if he could help me, and he showed me a way. I needed to add the "word.csv" file (Library of words) to repl.it. After doing this, i needed to link the file to my main code. I linked the two using ![](Project-03/Debugging snippet.PNG). This allowed my program to access the file.

Below is a screenshot showing the problem i encountered. The program is sorting through every word in the library. This is causing lag due to the massive amount of information that is being processed.

## Repl.it
- This IDE made it very easy to incorporate external files. Adding the external file containing the library was integral to this project.

# Current Version
Below is the current version of my anagram solver. It accepts users input, (word) and compares the letters and length of the word with the library. The problem i have is getting my program to stop, when a viable anagram has been found.
